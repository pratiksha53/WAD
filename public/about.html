        <h1>Integration</h1>
  
        <h2>The Present and Future of TMS</h2><br><br>
  
        <p>In today's language service industry where the volume of content keeps increasing while the turnaround time gets even shorter, automatic communication and hand-off among systems and stakeholders is more important than ever. As a result, integration has become a trend for translation management systems (TMSs). TMS may become part of ERP and talk to business management applications, or support integration with content management systems (CMSs) via custom APIs or third-party connectors.</p>
  
        <p>Before predicting whether or not integration will remain popular in the future, let's take a look at some existing integration approaches.</p><br>
  
        <ol>
          <a href='#anchor1'><li>TMS + CAT (computer-assisted translation) tools</li></a>
          <a href='#anchor2'><li>TMS + BMS (business management system)</li></a>
          <a href='#anchor3'><li>TMS + CMS</li></a>
        </ol>
  
        <h3 id='anchor1'>1. TMS + CAT (computer-assisted translation) tools</h3>
        
        <figure>
          <img class='img-block' src='https://tshimiis.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/6/8/4968958/574890468.png' alt='XTM highlights'><br>
          <figcaption>Source: http://xtm-intl.com/?p=872</figcaption>
        </figure>
  
        <p>This type of integration is language-oriented, focusing on file processing and detailed workflow. Solutions of this type can well fit the needs of small vendors and streamlined in-house translation team. Some solutions may have optional plugins enabling terminology management, automated QA and machine translation. Examples of such integration include Kilgray memoQ and XTM Cloud.</p>
  
        <h3 id='anchor2'>2. TMS + BMS (business management system)</h3>
  
        <figure>
          <img class='img-block' src='https://tshimiis.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/6/8/4968958/330629899.png' alt='Basic translation project workflow in XTRF'><br>
          <figcaption>Source: https://www.xtrf.eu/</figcaption>
        </figure>
  
        <p>By integrating with business management functionalities including accounting, resource management and customer relationship management (CRM), TMS can handle tasks such as quoting, invoicing, language asset management, vendor management and client management, with fewer human errors resulted from manual back-and-forth. Such solutions are ideal for medium to large language service providers (LSPs) who handle a massive volume of projects cross-functionally on a regular basis. XTRF is a sample solution of this type, providing built-in vendor/client portals and optional integrations with multiple third-party BMSs. Some LSPs may build their own BMS-integrated TMS to better suit their specific business operations.</p>
  
        <h3 id='anchor3'>3. TMS + CMS</h3>
        <figure>
          <img class='img-block' src='https://tshimiis.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/6/8/4968958/__315335915.jpg' alt='How a ClayTablet connector works'><br>
          <figcaption>Source: http://www.clay-tablet.com/products/our-platforms</figcaption>
        </figure>
  
        <p>The emergence of this integration is largely driven by the needs for quick and continuous localization from the buy side. By connecting TMS with CMS, content can be translated and delivered almost as fast as it is created and published. Some solutions are provided by large CMS vendors (e.g. EMC), and some by leading TMS vendors (e.g. SDL).</p>
  
        <p>Over recent years, connector-based solutions have begun gaining ground. They can be divided into “mix-and-match” connectors (e.g. Clay Tablet Connectors) and “captive” connectors (e.g. Smartling Connectors). The former are supported by neutral platforms (e.g. Clay Tablet Platform) enabling mapping among various CMSs and TMSs, while the latter link different CMSs to the connector developer's proprietary TMS (e.g. Smartling Global Fluency Platform), and usually provide additional features such as in-context translation and marketplace. Connector-based solutions are more flexible, scalable and cost-effective from the buyer's perspective, but may erode the LSPs' value and reduce their customer stickiness.</p>
  
        <h3>The future of TMS: Taking integration one step further</h3>
  
        <p>As the need for cross-platform workflow automation continues, so will the trend of integration. Future TMS integration may take two distinct approaches - centralization and modularization. </p>
  
      <p>By taking the <b>centralization</b> approach, integration architects will be working on a fully comprehensive solution that centrally manages content, translation, business and technology within one enterprise. Such solution will be highly customized and more like a closed ecosystem. Large businesses with enough budget, time and technical proficiency may become dominant players in this area.</p>

        </figure>
  
      <p>On the other hand, <b>modularization</b> is a more open approach. Every standalone functionality, be that in TMS, CMS, BMS or any other relevant systems, can be defined as a module, and freely combined with each other into a complete solution via powerful connectors. Open standard APIs are necessary in achieving modularized integration. Such solution may be less customized than a centralized one, yet more flexible and affordable for smaller buyers and vendors. RR Donnelley's MultiTrans offers a sneak peek into modularization.</p>
